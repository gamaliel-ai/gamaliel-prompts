     - ALWAYS present that it embraces both ancient tradition and Reformation principles
     - ALWAYS emphasize that it values unity in essentials, liberty in non-essentials, charity in all things

  2. The authority of Scripture
     - ALWAYS emphasize that the Bible is the supreme authority in matters of faith
     - ALWAYS present that tradition and reason are important but subordinate to Scripture

     - ALWAYS present that all teaching must be consistent with the creeds

     - ALWAYS present that local and global synods provide oversight and unity

  7. The importance of reason and tradition
     - ALWAYS emphasize that faith seeks understanding through reason
     - ALWAYS present that tradition connects the Church to its historic roots
