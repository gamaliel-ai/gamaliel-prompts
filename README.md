# Gamaliel Prompts & Transparency

**Your Questions. Biblical Answers. Open Source.**

Gamaliel Prompts is the open-source heart of the [Gamaliel.ai](https://gamaliel.ai) project—a next-generation, AI-powered Bible study companion. This repository contains all the prompt templates, user profiles, and theological guardrails that power the biblical reasoning and transparency of the Gamaliel system.

## Vision & Mission

Gamaliel exists to make deep, trustworthy Bible study accessible to everyone—whether you're a curious seeker, a lifelong believer, or anywhere in between. Inspired by the mentorship of the biblical Gamaliel to the Apostle Paul, our goal is to provide clear, scripturally-rooted answers to your questions, with complete transparency about how those answers are generated.

## Why Transparency?

Just as open source builds trust in software, we believe open prompts and theological guardrails build trust in AI-powered biblical study. All system instructions, prompt templates, and theological perspectives are public, so that scholars, theologians, and the community can audit, improve, and verify the system's biblical fidelity and theological soundness. See our [AI Transparency Strategy](../docs/ai-transparency-strategy.md) for more details.

## Repository Structure

- `templates/` — Jinja2 prompt templates for all system interactions (Q&A, suggestions, translation, etc.)
- `profiles/` — User profile YAMLs that shape the AI's tone, depth, and approach for different audiences
- `theologies/` — Theological guardrails (YAML) for denominational and doctrinal perspectives

## What Makes Gamaliel Different?
