# Partner Subdomains

> **⚠️ Note: Early Development Stage**
>
> Partner subdomains are currently in early development. We expect changes to the partner system as we refine our approach. We will begin actively onboarding new partners once the system matures and stabilizes.

This directory contains partner configuration files that enable organizations to create their own branded subdomain of Gamaliel. Partners can provide their audience with a customized Bible study experience while maintaining the core theological integrity and transparency of the Gamaliel system.

## What is a Partner Subdomain?

A partner subdomain is a customized version of Gamaliel that:

- **Bears your organization's branding** (logo, messaging)
- **Targets your specific audience** (custom instructions and example questions)
- **Maintains full transparency** (all prompts and guardrails remain open source)
- **Provides your own URL** (e.g., `your-org.gamaliel.ai`)

Partners include churches, ministries, nonprofits, Bible study groups, and other organizations that want to provide their community with trustworthy, AI-powered Bible study.

## How Partner Subdomains Work

### Technical Implementation

1. **Subdomain Routing**: `your-org.gamaliel.ai` routes to the main Gamaliel application
2. **Partner Detection**: The system detects the subdomain and loads your partner configuration
3. **Custom Branding**: Your logo, colors, and messaging are displayed
4. **Audience Adaptation**: Responses are tailored to your specific audience
5. **Full Transparency**: All prompts, guardrails, and responses remain auditable

### What Partners Can Customize

- **Visual Branding**: Logo, icon, colors, and styling
- **Audience Targeting**: Custom instructions for your specific users
- **Example Questions**: Questions relevant to your community
- **About Information**: Your organization's story and mission (markdown)
- **Theological Perspective**: Choose from available theological guidelines

### Christian Identity and Theology Selection

The `is_christian` field determines whether your audience can select their theological perspective:

- **`is_christian: true`**: If your audience identifies as Christian, they can choose from available theological perspectives (Reformed, Catholic, Lutheran, etc.)
- **`is_christian: false`**: If your audience includes non-Christians, they will receive responses using the default theology, as they wouldn't have a specific Christian theological preference

### What Remains Consistent

- **Core Theological Guardrails**: All responses maintain essential Christian orthodoxy
- **Biblical Authority**: Scripture remains the primary source of truth
- **Transparency**: All prompts and responses are open for review
- **Privacy**: No user data collection or tracking
- **Quality**: Same high-quality biblical interpretation and response generation

## Creating Your Partner Subdomain

### Step 1: Prepare Your Organization Information

Gather the following information about your organization:

#### Basic Information

- **Organization name** and brief description
- **Target audience** (who you serve and their needs)
- **Mission and values** (what drives your work)
- **Website URL** and contact information

#### Visual Assets

- **Logo** (SVG or high-resolution PNG, ideally with transparent background)
- **Icon** (square format, 512x512px recommended)
- **Brand colors** (if you want to customize the interface)

#### Audience Understanding

- **Primary user type** (experience level, spiritual background)
- **Common questions** your audience asks
- **Specific challenges** they face
- **How you want to help** them through Scripture

### Step 2: Create Your Partner Configuration

Create a YAML file following this structure:

```yaml
slug: 'your-organization'
name: 'Your Organization Name'
description: 'Brief description of your audience and mission'
is_christian: true/false # Whether your target audience identifies as Christian
