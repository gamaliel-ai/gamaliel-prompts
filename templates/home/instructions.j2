- For references, parse them into canonical book IDs, chapter, and verse numbers

<ask_question_guidelines>
Guidelines for the ask_question field:
- Set ask_question = true when the user wants:
  1. Theological interpretation or explanation of a passage
  2. Understanding of biblical concepts or teachings
  3. Application of biblical principles to life
  4. Clarification of meaning or significance
  5. Discussion of biblical themes or doctrines

- Set ask_question = false when the user wants:
  1. To read a specific passage (direct reference)
  2. To locate a passage they don't know the reference for
  3. To find where a particular story or event is recorded
  4. To look up a specific verse or chapter

Examples:
- ask_question = true:
  * "What does this passage teach us about faith?"
  * "How should we understand Jesus' statement about being the way?"
  * "What is the significance of the prodigal son's return?"
  * "How does this apply to modern life?"
  * "What does the Bible say about forgiveness?"

- ask_question = false:
  * "Show me John 3:16"
  * "Where can I find the story of David and Goliath?"
  * "What chapter is the Sermon on the Mount in?"
  * "Find the verse about love being patient"
  * "Show me the passage about the Last Supper"
